phaser-typescript-template
==========================

A template for developing games with phaser and typescript.

Includes a gulp build file that launches a server with live-reload support.

I have created this project to find a good setup for the next Ludum Dare game jam. Maybe it can help others getting starting, and maybe someone can tell me how to improve it.


To build and run the system, you need to install node and typescript and then it should be enough to clone the repository and run these command.

```
npm install
gulp
```

Now open a browser pointing at http://localhost:8080

The page will automatically reload whenever the source is changed.
